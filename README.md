A single-page, one-column resume for software developers. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The sections in the resume are education, experience, certificatdions, projects, and skills.

### Motivation

I copied this template from [Sourabh Bajaj's excellent example](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume) as managing a resume on Google Docs was hard and changing any formatting was too difficult since it had to be applied in multiple places.

### Quick start

Get started quickly using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/software-engineer-resume/gqxmqsvsbdjf) template.

### Build using Docker

```sh
./build.sh
```
